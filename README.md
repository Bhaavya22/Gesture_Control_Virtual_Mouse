# Gesture_Control_Virtual_Mouse

This project implements a virtual mouse control system using hand gestures. It utilizes the Mediapipe library for hand tracking and recognition, OpenCV for image processing, and PyAutoGUI for mouse control. The system recognizes various hand gestures and translates them into corresponding mouse actions.

## Features

- Gesture Recognition: Recognizes a variety of hand gestures, including fist, V-gesture, pinch, and more.
- Virtual Mouse Control: Uses recognized gestures to control the computer's mouse, allowing for various actions such as left-click, right-click, scrolling, and dragging.
- System Control: Implements additional functionalities like adjusting system brightness and volume based on specific gestures.

## Requirements
-Python 3.11
-OpenCV
-Mediapipe
-PyAutoGUI
-cvzone
-screen_brightness_control
-pycaw
